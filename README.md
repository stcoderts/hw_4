# hw_4

A new Flutter project created with FlutLab - https://flutlab.io

## Screens

# Welcome Screen:

Displays a tutorial on the first launch (using SharedPreferences).
Tutorial is shown only on the first launch.

# User List Screen:

Fetches user information from the Random User Generator API.
Displays user information in a list.
Provides buttons to fetch more users from the API and store selected data into a local SQLite database. And there is also a button to move to the Local User List Screen. 
I used Fade-in Animation in this page for table.

# Local User List Screen:

Reads user information from the local SQLite database.
Displays user information in a list. Also in this page, Fade-in Animation is used.
